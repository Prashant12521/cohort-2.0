Day:- 1 (How Internet Works)

History of the Web

Web 1.0 (1990s - early 2000s)
In the early stage of the internet, websites were static. They only contained fixed information and users could only read the content without interacting.
Example
Early news websites or company information pages.

Web 2.0 (2004 onwards)
This era introduced user-generated content and social interaction. People could not only consume but also create, share   and connect with others online.
* Rise of platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, and Blogs.
* Main focus: Community building, sharing and collaboration.

Web 3.0 (Now & Future)
The modern and future web is build on blockchain technology and decentralisation. Data is no longer stored in a single company’s server but distributed across many computers.
* User own their data and can also earn via tokens, NFTs, and smart contracts.
* Examples: Cryptocurrencies, decentralised apps (dApps), and Metaverse projects.


How Computers Communicate 

Every computer that connects to the internet has an IP Address, which acts like phone number. To communicate, computers follow specific rules knows as protocols.
* TCP/IP protocol is the foundation of the internet.
* Data is broken into small chunks called packets.
* Packets travel via cables, WiFi, or satellites.
* When they reach the destination, they are reassembled like pieces of a puzzle.


How Data Travels Across the World

The journey of data involves several key components:
* Routers: Work like traffic police, deciding the route of data packets.
* Switches: Connect devices inside a local network (e.g., your home WiFi).
* Undersea cables: Huge fibre optic cables that connect different countries and continents.
Example
A WhatsApp message sent from India to the USA moves through fiber optic undersea cables. If one route fails, the internet automatically finds an alternate path.



Domain Name, IP & MAC Address, Routing

Domain Name
A human-friendly way to access websites (e.g., google.com, amazon.in) instead of remembering numbers.

IP Address (Internet Protocol)
The numeric identity of a device or server (e.g., 142.240.34.329).
* Works like a phone number of your device on the internet.

MAC  Address (Media Access Control) 
A unique hardware ID given to every network card of a device.
* Works like an Aadhaar Card for your device — permanent and unique.

Routing
Routers analyse the network and decide the fastest and safest path for data packets to travel across the internet.



ISP & DNS Working Together

ISP (Internet Service Provider)
Companies like Jio, Airtel or BSNL that provide you with internet access. They connect your device to the global internet.

DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS works like the phonebook of the internet. It translate domain names into IP addresses so that computers can understand them.

Process Example:
1. You type google.com in the browser.
2. DNS translate it into its IP - 142.250.77.206.
3. Your ISP uses this IP to connect you to Google’s server.
Without DNS, we would have to remember long IP numbers for every single website.
