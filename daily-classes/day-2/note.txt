Day:- 2 (Client-Server Architecture)

What is Client-Server Model

The client-server model is the foundation of how the internet works.
* A Client is a device or program (like a browser or mobile app) that request data or services.
* A Server is a computer system that stores, processes and delivers the requested data to clients.
* Relationship: Client asks -> Server responds.

Example
You (client) request google.com in your browser -> Googleâ€™s server responds with the webpage.


Difference Between Client and Server

Client (Browser)
* Runs on the userâ€™s device (laptop, phone).
* Sends requests for resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript or images.	

Server
* A more powerful computer that stores websites, applications, or databases.
* Listens for incoming requests and responds accordingly.
* Stays always online and connected to ensure availability.


HTTP Request-Response Cycle

The communication between client and server happens in a cycle known as the HTTP request-response cycle.
1. User Action -> You type a URL or click a link.
2. Browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
3. Server processes the request (fetch data, execute logic, access databases).
4. Server sends an HTTP response back (HTML, JSON, images, or files).
5. Browser renders the page and place within milliseconds.
ðŸ‘‰ This entire cycle usually takes place within milliseconds.


What Happens When You Visit a Website

1. You type www.example.com in your browser.
2. Browser contacts the DNS to get the IP address of the website.
3. Browser connects to the correct server via ISP (Internet Service Provider).
4. Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request.
5. Server locates the requested page or data and sends it back.
6. Browser displays the website to you.


Frontend vs Backend

Frontend (Client-Side)
* The visible part of a website or application.
* Build using HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
* Focuses on UI/UX (buttons, forms, visuals, design).
* Example: The login form you see on your screen.

Backend (Server-Side)
* The hidden part of the system that runs on the server.
* Handles logic, authentication, database operations, APIs.
* Example: Checking whether your login credentials are correct.


 Static vs Dynamic Websites

Static Website
* Shows the same content to everyone.
* Built with pre-written HTML files.
* Very fast but limited in interactivity.
* Example: Portfolio sites, simple company info pages.

Dynamic Website
* Content changes based on user input or data.
* Built using backend logic + database integration.
* Example: Facebookâ€™s news feed or Amazonâ€™s product pages.


What is Web Hosting
Web hosting means renting space on a server to store your website files so that they can be accessed online.
* Hosting providers like Hostinger, AWS, GoDaddy keep your site running and accessible 24/7.
* Without hosting, your site cannot be seen on the internet.

Types of Web Hosting
* Shared Hosting: Multiple websites share one server (cheapest, but slower).
* VPS/Dedicated Hosting: A server is divided or dedicated for one website (more power, more cost)
* Cloud Hosting: Scalable and flexible hosting (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure).
